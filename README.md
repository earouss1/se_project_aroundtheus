# Project 3: Around The U.S.

This is my third project at Tripleten. The project is focusing on creating a well organize responsive design website. In this project, we used Figma and a lot of new concepts such as grid layout, media queries, etc.

## Figma

We use figma to determine the design layout of the website. It includes everything from the page structure for each media quieries to paddings, margins, fonts, and colors scheme for each blocks and elements of the website.

## Grid Layout

In addition to flex layout, we use grid layout to build our responsive design. Grid has many values that flex lack, not to say flex is not as a powerful layout, but with grid there is a lot you can control and do. I am looking forward to learn more and coding more using grid layout moving forward. One question that comes up a lot is which is better suited for responsie design. With more practice, I think I would have an answer to that question.

## Media Quieries

This helps conserve and well organize your webiste in multiple devices. In this project, we used _screen_ and _max-width_ to add breakpoint to change in a well function manner when the screen of the device changes. Also, our website can be opened in different devices.

## Things I can do better

Well, margins and paddings are still a little bit challeging for me. On my understanding, learning the proper position relies heavily on having the correct margins and paddings. I want to continue masturing tis craft. Also, this was my first time using figma, so it was a little bit challenging to understand the set up.
